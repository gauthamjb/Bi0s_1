#IQ signals
***Quadrature signals*** or ***IQ signals*** are used in RF application. These signals help in the modulation and demodulation of RF signals.\
They are called Quadrature as they differ in phase by 90 degrees.
The I signal is the inphase one and the Q signal is the quadrature
i.e the one which whose phase is shifted by 90 degrees. So we can create RF waves by varying I and Q waves vs time.\
We can create RD signals with any type of modulation with the help of the appropriate I(t) and Q(t) baseband signals.\
This can also be reversed and by the process of demodulation by mixing an RF signal with a local oscillator.\
m(t) the modulated RF signal is the sum of i(t)=a(t)cos(phi(t)) and q(t)=a(t)sin(phi(t))
