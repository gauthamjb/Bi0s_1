For getting the flag i used the data which was tapped and used it within the code, in the array named num and by also removing the input a and b from the user and changing the loop values in the function display which was 7 (denoting the array values) which was later increased to 15 hence the loop value was also increased to 15.

The code was run and the above given flag was printed out
