Here we use chmod 777 to make the file readable and executable to any user. We now use 'cat' to read what is in the file where we can see a word named "supersecret" . When we type in this as the password we get the output as correct  
> chmod 777 c\
> cat ./c\
> ./c\
> supersecret

>***password: supersecret***
